!["Main list"](/content/projects/juliana.jpg)

A personal project created for friends of mine that administrate a Telegram group based around the trading of turnips with the character Daisy May in the 2020 Animal Crossing game.

Once these turnips reach a decent price in a players' island, this person creates a list by talking to the bot in private.

When the list is created and is forwarded to a group (with the bot as a member), other users can enter the queue.

As these users leave the hosts' island with their turnips, they (should) mark themselves as "Visited".
