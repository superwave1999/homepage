Kalma are a wholesaler of all the items a dentist may need.

This project is a complete storefront with a product browser, cart, multi-gateway checkout process, customer support and returns.

Order info can be downloaded as a spreadsheet, and the cart can be filled from an uploaded spreadsheet.

The products are imported via a background scheduled job every day.

The API supports multiple stores, one being Kalma itself, and the rest are managed by Kalmas' customers.

The frontend can be configured to use different themes and layouts depending on the store configuration.
