For this project I was tasked to create an image generator for the different combination of product attributes of a Magento store.

Given a base image, and optionally, overlay images, these were to be combined into a single image that will be latterly assigned to a product variation.

The source images are automatically fetched by the generator.

The process is run via conveniently placed buttons in the backend. It can be run for a set of products or to generate the entire image set for the marketplace.
